<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<ul>
  <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
     <p> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the<br>
         ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof<br>
         dome that can be opened.</p>
  <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
     <p> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and<br>
         gas-fire stove. Your luxury camping experience includes<br>
         electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower<br>
         and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
   <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
     <p> Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress<br>
         for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also<br>
         helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!.</p>
