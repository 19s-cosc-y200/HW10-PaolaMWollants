<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
         ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
         dome that can be opened.<br></dd>
  <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and
        gas-fire stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
        electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
        and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.<br></dd>
   <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
        for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also
        helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!.<br></dd>
